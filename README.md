# Summary

This is an Apurinã treebank consisting of sentences from a grammatical description of the language by Maília Fernanda.


# Introduction

 The initial release contains 70 annotated sentences. This is the first treebank in a language from the Arawak family. The original interlinear glosses are included in the tree bank, and their conversion into a full UD annotation is an ongoing process. The sent_id values (e.g.: FernandaM2017:Texto-6-19) are representative of the collector, year of publication, text identifier and the number of the sentence in order from the original text.


# Acknowledgments

 This tree bank has been done in collaboration between the Federal University of Para (UFPA) and the University of Helsinki.
